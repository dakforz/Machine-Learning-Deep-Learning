Hello readers, these works are my recent ML/DL learning projects. Also, I have now officially cooperated with the medical institution on ML projects! :) 
<br> 
Because most of my works are done with Google CoLab, and some datasets are private, I do not post those coding works on GitHub! 
However, if you are interested in my research on the In silico study of aptamer-AS1411 and cancer biomarker-nucelolin interaction, please let me know. I will be happy to share it with you!
